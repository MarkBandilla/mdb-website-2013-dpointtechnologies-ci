    	<h1>Dan Padilla</h1>
        <p>From day one, Dan Padilla realized that an Effective Marketing Strategy coupled with dynamic, tech-savvy,
and dedicated staff would determine the success of DPoint Technologies in the field of information
technology and security surveillance systems.</p>
		<p>For a business to succeed, you need to know what is essential. You need to have a strong sense of what's
pre-nominal to you and your people. At DPoint Technologies, we consistently believe that the relationship
between our company and our clients is of utmost importance. Profit is not the principal objective on all our
ventures. We pursue excellence, we run after the best solutions for our clients at a rational price. Our
relationship does not end after full payment. It just began to take life.</p>
		<p>Innovation, orchestration and implementation should always be at optimum levels to succeed in this highly
competitive market. Excellence in all fields is a must. Highest quality of work is perpetual in every staffâ€™s
corporate vein. Our determination in giving the best on what we do sets us apart from our competitors. We
do not compete. We make the competition irrelevant.</p>
